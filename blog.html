            <p>Dreams - J. Cole</p>
            <p>Seems like I always had crushes on chicks I couldn't have And then I end up fuckin' with someone I shouldn't have See, in my mind, it's like I'm perfect for her, I gotta show her
                But sadly, in reality, dog, I don't even know her
                But still somehow she got my mind infatuated
                Absolutely fascinated
                With the thoughts of what she might be like
                Time after time after time I had to wait and
                Is fate procrastinatin'?
                I can take it 'cause I might be right, 'cause it's…</p>

            <p>This is the girl of my dreams
                Yeah, and is she good as what she seems?
                Or am I lyin' to myself?
                Aye, should I try and get some help?

            <p>Oh shit, she passed me on the boulevard
                Aye, tell me, is it stalkin' if I follow her
                Like, all the way home without her knowin'?
                Nah, nigga, I'm just curious where she stay at
                Besides, when I'm with her, this gon' be the spot we lay at
                And maybe I'll just drive by occassionally
                And if one day I happen to see her outside, she'll wave at me
                Imagine what she'll say to me
                This ain't no time to be afraid no more, it's time for bravery
                No matter if my homies think I'm crazy</p>
